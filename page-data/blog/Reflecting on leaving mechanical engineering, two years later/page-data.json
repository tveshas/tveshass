Alongside this, I am also pursuing Data Science at the Indian Institute of Technology, Madras. \nEver since I took Applied Physics, it lit a deep fascination with quantum mechanics, which naturally led me to explore the world of machine learning.\nAt university, I dedicate much of my time to machine learning and its adjacent fields—such as computer vision, natural language processing, and distributed systems—all of which I find pretty neat.\nI write tech blogs about pretty cool things and insights I gathered while learning. Check my Medium out.\nI am also deeply passionate about advocating for women empowerment and financial independence. It is something I believe is utterly essential in this time. We need more women in tech contributing to innovation. If you are interested in learning more about my thoughts on this topic, you can check out my blog where I dive deeper into these issues (:\n\nOutside of computer science, I love making cinamtic films, enjoy playing tennis, and cheering for Ferrari in Formula 1. Lately, My mind has been drawn to the wisdom of ages - exploring the depths of the Bhagavad Gita's teachings alongside Socrates' timeless insights. There's something deeply moving about seeing how these ancient perspectives still speak to our modern questions about life and truth.

This mission spans from bustling tech centers to quiet hamlets in India, Pakistan, and conflict-zones like Afghanistan.</p>\n<h3>Afghanistan: A Battle for Basic Rights</h3>\n<p>Afghan women face severe restrictions:\nSchooling beyond elementary level? Forbidden.\nMost jobs? Off-limits.\nDress codes and chaperone rules? Strictly enforced.\nYet, resilient Afghan women persist, embracing secret online classes and hidden learning spaces.</p>\n<h3>Rural India and Pakistan: Battling Tradition</h3>\n<p>Village women confront:\nScarce STEM education access\nEarly weddings and household duties trumping careers\nAge-old beliefs discouraging professional ambitions\nStill, local initiatives and aid groups are making headway, bringing tech and STEM learning to these areas.</p>\n<h2>The Global STEM Landscape: A Picture of Inequality</h2>\n<p>The numbers tell a troubling tale:\nEngineering? Only 1 in 5 students are women.\nComputer science? Even fewer—less than 1 in 5.\nPaychecks? Men pocket $85K yearly; women, just $61K.</p>\n<h3>Why the Gap Persists</h3>\n<p>Key factors include:\nOld-fashioned stereotypes\nToo few relatable role models\nEducation hurdles\nSocial expectations favoring homemaking over careers</p>\n<h3>Root Causes of Gender Disparity in STEM</h3>\n<p>Several factors contribute to this persistent gap:\nEntrenched Stereotypes: STEM fields are often perceived as masculine domains, a view that takes root as early as preschool.\nLack of Role Models: Girls have limited exposure to female scientists and engineers, especially women from their own cultural backgrounds.\nEducational Barriers: In many regions, girls face restricted access to quality STEM education.\nCultural Expectations: Societal norms often prioritize domestic roles for women over professional pursuits.</p>\n<h2>Roya Mahboob: Afghanistan’s Tech Pioneer</h2>\n<p>Despite facing threats from the Taliban, Roya Mahboob founded Afghan Citadel Software Company, employing numerous women. She continues to advocate for girls’ education in technology.</p>\n<h2>Project Drawdown: Empowering Rural Indian Women</h2>\n<p>This initiative trains women in Punjab to install and maintain solar panels, simultaneously addressing climate change and gender inequality in STEM.</p>\n<h2>The Promise of Progress</h2>\n<p>Investing in women’s STEM involvement—from remote villages to top labs—isn’t just about equality. It’s about tapping into a wellspring of innovation and talent. Our tech future hinges on embracing all bright minds, regardless of gender or birthplace.\nThe road to STEM equality is long, but united global action can create a world where a Pakistani village girl dreams of space exploration, and an Afghan woman sparks a tech revolution—not just at home, but worldwide.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"We Need More Women In STEM (5 minute read)","date":"November 22, 2024","description":"If you too are thinking about this, let's talk."}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/Reflecting on leaving mechanical engineering, two years later/","previous":null,"next":null}},
