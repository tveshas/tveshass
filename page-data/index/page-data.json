If you need an engineer who can quickly prototype concepts and scale them up, I could be the person you’re looking for.","about":"Hey there, I am Tvesha, a second-year Computer Science student at Indira Gandhi Delhi Technical University for Women. Alongside this, I am also pursuing Data Science at the Indian Institute of Technology, Madras. \nEver since I took Applied Physics, it lit a deep fascination with quantum mechanics, which naturally led me to explore the world of machine learning.\nAt university, I dedicate much of my time to machine learning and its adjacent fields—such as computer vision, natural language processing, and distributed systems—all of which I find pretty neat.\nI write tech blogs about pretty cool things and insights I gathered while learning. Check my Medium out.\nI am also deeply passionate about advocating for women empowerment and financial independence. It is something I believe is utterly essential in this time. We need more women in tech contributing to innovation. If you are interested in learning more about my thoughts on this topic, you can check out my blog where I dive deeper into these issues (:\n\nOutside of computer science, I love making cinamtic films, enjoy playing tennis, and cheering for Ferrari in Formula 1.","author":"https://medium.com/@tveshasingh25","email":"tveshasingh25@gmail.com","github":"https://github.com/tveshas","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/tvesha-singh/","resume":"","projects":[{"name":"Spotify Analyser","description":"AI gives it's two cents on your Spotify profile.
